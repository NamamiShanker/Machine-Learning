# Machine-Learning
## Some Machine Learning Algorithms with examples

I was a Python teacher for some time, where I used to teach children in grade school the basics of machine learning. It was a wonderful experience and It helped 
me understand Machine Learning from its very core, removing the mathematical aspect, enjoying its wonderful beauty.

Here are some basic Machine Learning model that I had opportunity to teach while Mentoring students.

Each folder contains a self explanatory Interactive Python Notebook, along with the training and testing dataset.

Hope this will help other educators as well.
